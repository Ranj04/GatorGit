# What is gatorgit?

git is a great tool for managing source code and other files. 

At its core, gatorgit is essentially a simpler version of git. gatorgit can track individual files in the current working directory (no subdirectories!). It maintains a .gatorgit/ subdirectory containing information about your repository. For each commit that the user makes, a directory is created inside the .gatorgit/ directory (.gatorgit/<ID>, where <ID> is the ID of the commit). The .gatorgit/ directory additionally contains two files: .index (a list of all currently tracked files, one per line, no duplicates) and .prev (contains the ID of the last commit, or 0..0 if there is no commit yet). Each .gatorgit/<ID> directory contains a copy of each tracked file (as well as the .index file) at the time of the commit, a .msg file that contains the commit message (one line) and a .prev file that contains the commit ID of the previous commit.

# Key differences between gatorgit and git:
1. The only supported commands are init, add, rm, commit and status. For each of them, only the most basic command line options are supported.
gatorgit does not track diffs between files. Instead, each time you make a commit, it simply copies all files that are being tracked into the .gatorgit/<ID> directory (where <ID> is the commit ID). 
2. Commit IDs are not based on cryptographic hash functions, but instead are a fixed sequence of 40-character strings that only contain 'c', 's', '2', '5' and '6' (why we chose those characters is left as an exercise to the reader). Any commits with a commit message that does not contain "GOLDEN GATOR!" (with exactly this capitalization and spelling) will be rejected with an error message.
```
Example Commit IDs:

First commit ID: cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
Second commit ID: cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccs
Third commit ID: cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc2

... and so on.
```
4. No user, date or other additional information is tracked by gatorgit. It does not allow to track subdirectories.
5. The rm command only causes gatorgit to stop tracking a file, but does not delete it from the file system.


# Files:
gatorgit.c - This is the file that you will fill in with your implementation of gatorgit.
gatorgit.h - Do not edit - This file contains declarations of various constructs in gatorgit.c along with convenient #defines. See the "Important Numbers" section below.
main.c - Do not edit - Contains the main for gatorgit (which parses command line options and calls into the functions defined in gatorgit.c).
Makefile - Do not edit - This tells the program make how to build your code when you run the make command. This is a convenient alternative to having to repeatedly type long commands involving gcc.
util.h - Do not edit - Contains helper functions that you may wish to use when completing the assignment.

# Other Info: 

Handling I/O (more than just printf):
Unix machines use a concept called "streams" to handle arbitrary I/O. We will need two of these output streams in this homework. The first is stdout, which is where your output goes when you call printf. We will use stdout to output all output indicating a "successful" action. The other output stream is stderr, which is where we will output all error messages. By default, both of these streams, stdout and stderr, are printed to your screen when you run a program.

Outputting to either stdout or stderr can be done similarly to using printf. The only change is that you use the fprintf function, and the first argument you pass in must be either "stderr" or "stdout" (without quotes).

```
[inside your C code]
fprintf(stdout, "%d\n", 3); // prints the number 3 to stdout, along with a newline
fprintf(stderr, "%d\n", 4); // prints the number 4 to stderr, along with a newline
```

If you want to know what messages went to stdout or stderr, you can forward them to a file instead of the terminal, by appending 2>log_err and/or 1>log_out to your command (e.g., ./my_program 2>log_err). This will forward everything from stderr to the file log_err (and equivalently for stdout if you add 1>log_out).

Included helper functions:
To make life easier for you, we provide helper functions for common operations that you will encounter while implementing gatorgit. You fill find these in utils.h. Here is a brief overview of each of these functions:

```
void fs_mkdir(const char* dirname): Create a new directory of name dirname
void fs_rm(const char* filename): Delete the file filename
void fs_mv(const char* src, const char* dst): Move the file src to dst, potentially overwriting it
void fs_cp(const char* src, const char* dst): Copy the file src to dst, potentially overwriting it
void write_string_to_file(const char* filename, const char* str): Create or overwrite the file filename and write str into it, including the NULL-character
void read_string_from_file(const char* filename, char* str, int size): Open the file filename and read its content into the location pointed to by str; limit the amount to read to at most size bytes, including the NULL character
```

The last two functions should only be used together. Specifically, don't try to use read_string_from_file to read multi-line files, but only for single strings that you previously wrote into a file using write_string_to_file.

While these functions perform some basic checks to prevent you from accidentally overwriting important files, be careful whenever you call any function that modifies the file system. There is always a risk of unintentionally deleting or overwriting files, especially when working on your own machine!

The first thing you should do is to compile your code. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```
$ make gatorgit
$ ./gatorgit init
```

# Steps to implement gatorgit

Step 1: The status command
Functionality:
The status command in gatorgit should read the file .gatorgit/.index and print a line for each tracked file. The exact format is described below. Unlike git status, gatorgit status should not print anything about untracked files.

Output to stdout:
```
$ gatorgit status
Tracked files:

  <file1>
  [...]
  <fileN>

<N> files total
```
For each file in the above output, <file*> should be replaced with the filename of that file.

Return value and output to stderr:
This function should always return 0 (indicating success) and should never output to stderr.


Step 2: The rm command


Functionality:
The rm command in gatorgit takes in a single argument, which specifies the file to remove from the index (which is stored in the file .gatorgit/.index). If the filename passed in is not currently being tracked, you should print an error as indicated below. Note that this behavior is different from git in that it doesn't delete the file from your file system.

Output to stdout:
None.

Return value and output to stderr:
If the filename specified in the provided argument exists in the index, the function should return 0 and produce no output on stderr. If the filename specified does not exist in the index, the function should return 1 and output the following to stderr:
```
$ gatorgit rm FILE_THAT_IS_NOT_TRACKED.txt
ERROR: File <filename> not tracked
```
Step 3: The commit command
Functionality:
The commit command involves a couple of steps:

First, check whether the commit string contains "GOLDEN GATOR!". If not, display an error message. Read the ID of the previous last commit from .gatorgit/.prev. Generate the next ID (newid) in such a way that: All characters of the id are either 'c','s','2', '5' or '6'. Generating 100 IDs in a row will generate 100 IDs that are all unique.

Generate a new directory .gatorgit/<newid> and copy .gatorgit/.index, .gatorgit/.prev and all tracked files into the directory.
Store the commit message (<msg>) into .gatorgit/<newid>/.msg
Write the new ID into .gatorgit/.prev.


Return value and output to stderr:
If the commit message does not contain the exact string "GOLDEN GATOR!", then you must output the following to stderr and return 1:

```
$ gatorgit commit -m "G-O- -G-A-T-O-R-!"
ERROR: Message must contain "GOLDEN GATOR!"
If the commit message does contain the string "GOLDEN GATOR!", then the function should produce no output and return 0.
```
